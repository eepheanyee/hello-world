#Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with GKE

##Overview In this lab, you create a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster containing several containers, each containing a web server. You place a load balancer in front of the cluster and view its contents.

##Objectives In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

- Provision a Kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes Engine.

- Deploy and manage Docker containers using kubectl.
##Steps

1: enable the following needed APIs are (Kubernetes Engine API, Container Registry API)

gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable containeranalysis.googleapis.com
2: For convenience, place the zone that Qwiklabs assigned you to into an environment variable called MY_ZONE.

export MY_ZONE=us-central1-a
3: Start a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubernetes Engine. Name the cluster webfrontend and configure it to run 2 nodes:

gcloud container clusters create webfrontend --zone $MY_ZONE --num-nodes 2
4: After the cluster is created, check your installed version of Kubernetes using the kubectl version command:

kubectl version
5: View your running nodes.

gcloud container node-pools list --cluster=webfrontend --zone us-central1-a
6: From your Cloud Shell prompt, launch a single instance of the nginx container. (Nginx is a popular web server.)

kubectl create deploy nginx --image=nginx:1.17.10
7: View the pod running the nginx container:

kubectl get pods
8: Expose the nginx container to the Internet:

kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type LoadBalancer
9: View the new service:

kubectl get services
10: Copy your cluster's external IP address and Open a new web browser tab and paste your cluster's external IP address into the address bar. The default home page of the Nginx browser is displayed.

11: Scale up the number of pods running on your service:

kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas 3
12: Confirm that Kubernetes has updated the number of pods:

kubectl get pods
13: Confirm that your external IP address has not changed:

kubectl get services
14: Return to the web browser tab in which you viewed your cluster's external IP address. Refresh the page to confirm that the nginx web server is still responding.

Thanks!
